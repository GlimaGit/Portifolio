          Hey!
          </p>
          <p class="text-xl mb-6 italic">
            My name is Gabriel Lima, I'm 19 years old and I'm a Full Stack Developer.
    My trajectory at the  programming area started very early. When I was 13 I made my first blog with HTML and, because of it, my passion for technology increased. I started to study some programming languages ‚Äã‚Äã2 years ago like JavaScript and PHP.
    Nowadays, I'm studying System Analysis at Instituto Federal de S√£o Paulo (IFSP) in the 3rd semester.
    I am currently unemployed and looking for an opportunity to develop my knowledge.

            In Searchit you can find your favorite movies and TV series in a simple and easy way.
            The project started with the purpose of facilitating the search for movies by their features (writing some part of the movie or a summary of what happened in it),
            making accessible the most popular movies and series from the most famous streaming platforms. The website was developed using the technologies: JavaScript, CSS, HTML and OMBD as API.
